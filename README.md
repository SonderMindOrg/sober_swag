# SoberSwag

![Ruby Test Status](https://github.com/SonderMindOrg/sober_swag/workflows/Ruby/badge.svg?branch=master)

SoberSwag is a combination of [Dry-Types](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-types/1.2/) and [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) that makes your Rails APIs more awesome.
Other tools generate documenation from a DSL.
This generates documentation from *types*, which (conveniently) also lets you get supercharged strong-params-on-steroids.
