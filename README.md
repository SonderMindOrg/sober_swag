Talk about what types your controller works with, and get back a representation of that.

## Known Issues:

1. Having an array as a top-level type currently breaks!
   Oops.
   This is something I know how to fix but don't have time to at the moment.
2. The description field of response types is broken when serializing yaml because I forgot the order of something.
   I'm not quite sure *what* I forgot the order of, but whatever.
